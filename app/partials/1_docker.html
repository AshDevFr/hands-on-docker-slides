      <h3>What is Docker?</h3>

      <p>
         Docker allows you to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software
         development.

         <p>
            Docker containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to
            run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries â€“ anything you can install on a server.
